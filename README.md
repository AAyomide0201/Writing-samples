# Writing-samples
Contains various forms of my (graded) academic writing samples.
For those interested in my written communication skills, these 
are a few samples from my recently concluded Master's degree
in Digital Technologies & Policy from the University College London (UCL).
The samples are graded papers and all represent analysis of science, technology,
engineering and public policy-related topics undertaken in the 2020/21 academic year.
